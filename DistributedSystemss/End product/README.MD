This Software was part of the subject "Distributed Systems" in which we learned about how to use UDP, TCP, RPC,MQTT , Docker and many other Modern Communications ways.

This project was written by me and Another person in my Team. 

The Code Quality of this project doesnt reflect my current code capabilities , The more we code the more we learn and our code gets better and better, i could refactor the Project but it would be too time consuming   

Enjoy
