This Software was part of the subject "Distributed Systems" in which we learned about how to use UDP, TCP, RPC,MQTT , Docker and many other Modern Communications ways.

In this Project the assigment was the create a simple "Simulation" of a Powerplant and its users. 
We designed the System in a way which the Consumers and the Producers communicate freely with each other, they run in the same process, and ever Transaction of "energy" gets reported the the main station which saves the Data.
We then Created multiple Mainstatsions and each had thier own consumers and producers that they needed to watchover. 
all the Data gets also saved to a 3rd party. which also gets used when a mainstations turns off for some reason so we can keep the Data consistency.

This project was written by me and Another person in my Team. 

The Code Quality of this project doesnt reflect my current code capabilities , The more we code the more we learn and our code gets better and better, i could refactor the Project but it would be too time consuming   

Enjoy
