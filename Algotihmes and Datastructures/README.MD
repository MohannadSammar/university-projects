This Software was part of the subject "algorithms and data structure" which i compeleted in the first and second Semesters. 

We learned the basics of codeing with C++ with simple Algorithmes, but it got more complicated towars the end where we had to write those 2 projects.


The Code Quality of this project doesnt reflect my current code capabilities , The more we code the more we learn and our code gets better and better, i could refactor the Project but it would be too time consuming   

Enjoy
